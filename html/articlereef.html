            <h1>Save the Great Barrier reef</h1>
            <p>The Great Barrier Reef is slowly starting to look like the Great Trash Compactor. Luckily enough, there are things that we, as individuals, can do to prevent it from  worsening as much.</p>
            <p>Basically, you shouldn't throw things where they don't belong. And trash doesn't belong in the ocean. The Great Barrier Reef is just an example of one of the many places out there impacted by us.</p>
